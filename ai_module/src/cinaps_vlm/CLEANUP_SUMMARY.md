# QA Node Cleanup Summary

## Changes Made

1. **Consolidated QA Node Implementation**
   - Kept the improved QA node with enhanced synonym dictionary as the main implementation
   - Renamed `improved_qa_node.py` to `qa_node.py`
   - Updated class name from `ImprovedQANode` to `QANode`
   - Updated node name and logging messages

2. **Removed Experimental Implementations**
   - Deleted `llm_qa_node.py` - experimental LLM-based implementation
   - Deleted `llm_qa_node_fixed.py` - fixed version of LLM implementation
   - Archived `qa_node_basic.py.bak` (original basic implementation)

3. **Organized Diagnostic Files**
   - Created `diagnostics/` directory for analysis tools
   - Moved the following files to diagnostics/:
     - `analyze_ground_truth.py`
     - `performance_diagnostics.py`
     - `performance_report.json`
     - `validate_answers.py`
     - `qa_node_basic.py.bak`

## Current Structure

The main QA node (`qa_node.py`) now includes:
- Enhanced synonym dictionary based on diagnostic findings
- Improved question parsing
- Better handling of spatial relations
- Support for all three question types (numerical, object reference, navigation)

## No Changes Required

- `scripts/qa_node` - Already imports the correct module
- `launch/world_model_node.launch` - Already launches the correct node
- `CMakeLists.txt` - No changes needed

The system is now cleaner and ready for deployment with the enhanced QA node as the primary implementation.
